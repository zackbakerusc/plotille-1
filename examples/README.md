# Plotille Examples

A handful of examples showing basic operation of the library.   

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Most examples just require plotille, but the more elaborate examples require numpy, scikit-learn, and/or pandas.   

### Installing

* You can install all of the dependencies via
  ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Executing Examples

* Draw a simple house shape with lines
  ```
   python example_house.py
  ```

* Draw a sine wave plot with lines
  ```
   python example_single_plot.py
  ```

* Draw a histogram plot 
  ```
   python example_single_hist.py
  ```

* Draw a variety of ellipse shapes demonstrating tilt and circle functionality
  ```
   python example_ellipse.py
  ```
  
  
* Draw a single point scatter plot
  ```
   python example_single_scatter.py
  ```
  
* Draw the Olympic Rings (multiple overlapping circles)
  ```
   python example_olympic_rings.py
  ```

* Draw a sine wave plot with data markers
  ```
   python example_scatter_with_markers_and_labels.py
  ```

* Draw a scatter plot with text labels for each point
  ```
   python example_scatter_cats.py
  ```

* Generate randomized data points, cluster the points into three groups, and draw the points in different colors and an ellipse around the clusters (Requires scikit-learn)
  ```
   python example_kmeans.py 
  ```

* Fetch time series stock data and plot it (Requires pandas)
  ```
   python example_stocks.py
  ```
